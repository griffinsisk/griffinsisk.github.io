## Customer Work

Selected pre-sales engagements (anonymized; Griffin doesn't name customers
without a public reference). These are representative of how he runs technical
evaluations at CloudZero: scope success criteria up front, build against the
customer's real data, own blockers personally, and translate the technical
work into a business case executives can act on.

- **A global cyber-resilience company** (~$120M/year across AWS, AWS
  GovCloud, Azure with ~200 subscriptions, Azure GovCloud, and GCP): an
  11-month proof of value that closed at $900K TCV on a three-year
  agreement, Griffin's largest deal at CloudZero.
  He wrote a script to push Azure GovCloud billing exports through CloudZero's
  AnyCost path in Common Bill Format, solving the FedRAMP blocker in week
  three; built cost-center, platform, payer, and customer dimensions across
  11 AWS billing organizations for the customer's cloud-native backup
  business; and surfaced ~$200K/year in orphaned KMS keys plus $44K and $67K
  anomalies within days of connecting data. The deal stalled for months under
  a new CFO. What revived it was AI: Griffin demonstrated native connectors
  for Claude, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Bedrock, and Vertex AI
  with per-user, per-model, and per-department cost and token detail, budgets
  and alerts down to the individual user, and an export path to the
  customer's Databricks warehouse. The two-person data team that had spent
  three months hand-building AI pipelines became the champions who pushed
  procurement to sign early, and the customer joined CloudZero's AI design
  partner program. Griffin then wrote the customer success handoff and led the
  first AI onboarding session himself.
- **A digital-asset infrastructure company** (roughly $7–8M in annual AWS
  spend, 8 Kubernetes clusters): went from first demo to closed in 28 days
  with one of the most technically demanding evaluators he's faced: a staff
  infrastructure engineer with deep billing-data expertise. Griffin handled
  node-level cost double-counting validation, network cost attribution edge
  cases, and brought GitHub Actions spend (~$30K/month) into the cost model
  via custom ingestion. Being straight about what the product didn't do yet
  became a trust accelerant rather than an objection.
- **A global supply-chain SaaS company** (~$11–13M annual AWS spend): a
  4-month competitive evaluation across 15 technical sessions and 20+
  stakeholders, surviving a mid-engagement champion departure. The trial
  identified ~$475K/year in actionable savings, and the customer's
  engineering team actioned $175K of it before the contract was even signed.
  Griffin built the allocation model for the ~25% of spend that was shared
  infrastructure and turned it into a CFO-ready business case, including
  short async video walkthroughs for executives who couldn't attend live.
- **A healthcare data analytics platform** serving major insurance payers:
  3-week proof-of-concept to close, aligning nine stakeholders across
  finance, engineering, data governance, and security. Griffin built
  client-level cost attribution from the customer's real crosswalk files
  (mapping Databricks workloads to the end-clients they serve), and the
  CISO kept routing technical questions to him after close, including
  third-party pricing-change impact analysis. The account expanded 17% at
  renewal.
- **A global workforce-management SaaS provider** (AWS + GCP, Kubernetes on
  four continents): replaced a 3–4 hour crash-prone Excel-based allocation
  process. The novel problem was multi-currency reporting; Griffin designed a
  currency-conversion architecture using exchange-rate telemetry streams,
  something no prior tool in their stack had handled, alongside
  telemetry-based allocation of shared Cassandra and Kubernetes costs.
- **A Web3 data infrastructure company** with a genuinely non-standard need:
  per-customer cost attribution down to database-table granularity. Griffin
  designed a telemetry-ingestion workflow for it, connected their full
  environment live in a single kickoff call, and stayed in the problem until
  it worked, and the customer's BizOps lead cited that persistence as what made
  them comfortable moving forward.

Earlier track record: led the largest commercial deal in CloudHealth product
history (automated ingestions, complex allocation model, ~20% actionable
savings identified); 100%+ quota across 7 consecutive half-years at VMware;
built an automated outreach program that turned cost data into expansion
signals across a 100+ account book with retention above 90%.
